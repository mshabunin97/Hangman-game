This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game, where your task is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters. Each correctly guessed letter will be revealed in its corresponding position in the word, while each incorrect guess will add a part to the hangman drawing. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the hangman drawing is completed.

## Features

* Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
* Tracks the number of remaining attempts and displays it to the player.
* Shows placeholders for letters in the guessed word.
* Allows the player to input letters by clicking on the buttons of the virtual on-screen keyboard.
* Updates the hangman drawing and reduces the number of attempts for incorrect guesses.
* Notifies the player of victory or defeat at the end of the game.
